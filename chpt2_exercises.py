# Exercise 2: Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.
# Enter your name: Chuck
# Hello Chuck
# print("Enter your name: ")
# userName = input()
# print('Hello ' + userName)

# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.
# Enter Hours: 35
# Enter Rate: 2.75
# Pay: 96.25
# We wonâ€™t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.
# print('Enter Hours')
# hours = float(input())
# print('Enter Rate')
# rate = float(input())
# print('Your payout is ' + str(hours * rate))

# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).
#
# width//2
#
# width/2.0
#
# height/3
#
# 1 + 2 * 5
# 1) 8
# Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

# 2) 8.5
# 3) 4.0
# 4) 11
# print(1 + 2 * 5)

# Exercise 5: Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.
# print('Enter a Temperature in Celsius:')
# celsius = float(input())
# fahrenheit = 9/5 * celsius + 32
# print('Temperature in Fahrenheit:', fahrenheit)
