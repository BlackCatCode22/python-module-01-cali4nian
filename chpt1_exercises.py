# Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?
# c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle

# Exercise 2: What is a program?
# A program is a set of instructions the computer understands that solves
# a problem for the end user.

# Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
# A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then
# it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language
# in a file for later execution. An interpreter allows code to be more portable
# with other machines with different hardware and software.

# Exercise 4: Which of the following contains “machine code”?
# a) The Python interpreter

# Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:

# >>> primt 'Hello world!'
# File "<stdin>", line 1
#   primt 'Hello world!'
#                      ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
# >>>

# Answer Exercise 5: the command is misspelled and missing key syntax errors.
# Correct version is print('Hello world!')


# Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after the following Python line finishes?
# x = 123
# b) Main Memory

# Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:
# x = 43
# x = x - 1
# print(x)
# b) 42

# Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3) Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example, “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?
# CPU processes data for output or result, Main memory holds what is next
# for a CPU to process, Secondary Memory is used for long time storage, Input
# Device are devices such as keyboard, mouse, and microphone, Output Device are devices
# such as printer, screens, and audio speakers.
